# tcgmm
A novel R package for two-condition Gaussian Mixture Model (TCGMM).

TCGMM aims to solve the clustering problems of data from two conditions (e.g., a case-control experiment). It takes both between-type variation and between-condition variation into account. More details about usage can be found in functions.

To install TCGMM, run the code in R:
```R
library(devtools)
install_github("SONGDONGYUAN1994/tcgmm")
```
